### Description
This project demonstrates how to connect a NodeMCU board to Wi-Fi and access a Firebase database. It utilizes the following libraries:

- FirebaseESP8266: Library for connecting to Firebase on the ESP8266 platform.
- WiFiUdp: Library for UDP communication over Wi-Fi.
- ESP8266WiFi: Library for Wi-Fi communication with the ESP8266 board.
- NTPClient: Library for retrieving time from NTP servers.

### Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Install the necessary libraries mentioned above.
2. Configure your Wi-Fi credentials in the code.
3. Set up your Firebase database and obtain the necessary credentials (API key, database URL, etc.).
4. Replace the placeholder code with your own code to read commands from the Firebase database and generate the desired output.
